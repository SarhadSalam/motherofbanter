#Bugs
1. Think of what to do with users who don't verify themselves.
2. Update so that users can update their username
3. Update the filesystem, should be easy.
4. update users table so that it contains a specific site_id for each user.
5. Idea on how to use resend email:
	a. Create a resent unit, and make sure it's smaller than 5 always.
	b. Use the resent unit to validate the user if he is eligible,
	c. to resend the email, just get the email or the username of the user 		   trying to login and send the email to that address again, if it's above 	   5 time, say fuck you user.

#Not Bugs
1. Implement a forget your password
2. Implement resend mail functionality
3. Think of logic for admin and normal users
4. Create videos, blogs, blah blah blah
5. Think about dropzone.js, looks like a nice option.
