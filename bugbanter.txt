#Bugs
1. Update so that social users can update their username
2. Update the filesystem, should be easy. use identifier
3. think of how signed up users can resend email, I can't seem to figure that out.******* use jquery to hide link, until time passes!.
4. All for today folks

#Not Bugs
1. Implement a forget your password
3. Think of logic for admin and normal users
4. Create videos, blogs, blah blah blah
5. Think about dropzone.js, looks like a nice option.
6. Maybe social users update their profile each time they log in?
