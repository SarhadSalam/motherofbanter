#Bugs:
1. When a comment/post is deleted, the likes should be deleted alongwith it!
2. Reporting, where should it go? A messaging system for motherofbanter, or motherofbanters mail?
3. Notifications
4. Show on user wall their activity, such as where they commented, and where they liked/disliked etc.
5. Do friggin awesome in school m8ey
#Just Random Thoughts:
1. Think of logic for admin and normal users.
2. Create videos, blogs, blah blah blah.
3. Think about dropzone.js, looks like a nice option.
6. ElasticSearch
