#Bugs:
1. Put a kitty and edit errors
2. Implement reporting and deleting
3. Status images comments like and dislike, update!
4. Update status_image to use ajax

#Just Random Thoughts:
1. Think of logic for admin and normal users.
2. Create videos, blogs, blah blah blah.
3. Think about dropzone.js, looks like a nice option.
6. ElasticSearch
