#Bugs:
2. Reporting, where should it go? A messaging system for motherofbanter, or motherofbanters mail? [[The only viable way is adding an admin logic]]
3. Notifications
4. Show on user wall their activity, such as where they commented, and where they liked/disliked etc.

#Just Random Thoughts:
1. Think of logic for admin and
 normal users.
2. Create videos, blogs, blah blah blah.
3. Think about dropzone.js, looks like a nice option.
6. ElasticSearch
